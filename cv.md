## About me
_My priorities are to get as much knowledge and practice in Web Development as possible. I have no much experience in this area, I did only the layout of separate blocks of web pages. My main aim is self-development and skills development in this sphere. And of course I'm interested in mastering IT-speciality. I have a good memory, wide range of interests and a huge desire of opening new horizons._
